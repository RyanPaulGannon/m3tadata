# M Œû T A D ü¶ß T A

This is an attempt to build an open-source [Zapper](https://zapper.fi/)/[Zerion](https://app.zerion.io/) based on [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) and supercharge it with [Dune](https://dune.com)-like analytics.

![Preview](https://m3ta-data.vercel.app/preview.png)

The idea is to focus mostly on powerful wallet analytics, e.g.

- Detailed charts of wallet activity
- Funds spent on gas over time
- Ingoing/outgoing addresses with transaction frequency
- Asset distribution between networks
- Airdrop detection
- Ecosystem overview for each network with links
- etc.

For now, only ETH networks: [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org), [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io), [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology), [Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io), [zkSync](https://zksync.io), etc.

## Goals

### Powerful web app 

Secure web app that connects to all the popular wallets, starting with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io).

### Web-only

No native apps! Native apps are not suitable for web3 as they are subject to App Store / Play Store T&Cs and lock out a big part of the global population. Instead, let's leverage the web platform to deliver native-like mobile apps (more on that in [this post](https://itnext.io/lets-build-a-native-like-web-app-nwa-22a553fee338)).
